# GameSnake
This is a snake game project using Frame and Java Applet knowledge. This was my grade 12 Computer Science project.  The code here could be running on Eclipse IDE. When running, please have the SnakeMain window open and click one run, that is, Rules can be run independently but I have incorporated that within the SnakeMain file for convenience.
